# Shadows

Former Independent Study, now converted to senior project! See the folder 'Just' for the actual, organized engine; what remains in the parent folder is mostly remnants from tutorials, the former years, and random testing grounds for new coding techniques.

The actual code itself is a simple OpenGL rendering engine written in C++, with some physics simulation added. Eventually I'm looking to make this into a full game engine (give me a few years!).
